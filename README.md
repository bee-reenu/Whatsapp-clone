## Overview

This project aims to replicate the core functionalities and user interface of WhatsApp. While it's not a production-ready application, it showcases our ability to work with Flutter, manage state, handle UI elements, and potentially integrate with backend services (depending on the features implemented).

## Features Implemented (List the features you have successfully implemented)

- **Basic UI Structure:**
  - Home screen with tabs for Chats, Status, and Calls.
  - Individual chat screen.
  - Basic profile view.
- **Chat Functionality (if implemented):**
  - Displaying a list of chats.
  - Sending and receiving text messages (may be simulated or connected to a backend).
  - Displaying message timestamps.
- **Status Functionality (if implemented):**
  - Viewing status updates from contacts (may be static or simulated).
- **Calls Functionality (if implemented):**
  - Displaying a list of call logs (may be static or simulated).
- **UI Elements and Design:**
  - Utilizing Flutter widgets to create a user-friendly interface.
  - Adhering to a design similar to WhatsApp (colors, icons, layout).
- **State Management (Specify the state management solution used, e.g., Provider, BLoC, Riverpod, setState):**
  - [Mention the state management approach used and why.]
- **Other Features (if any):**
  - [List any other specific features you implemented.]

## Features Planned (List any features you intended to implement but haven't yet)
