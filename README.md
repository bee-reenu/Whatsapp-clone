## Overview

This project aims to replicate the core functionalities and user interface of WhatsApp. While it's not a production-ready application, it showcases our ability to work with Flutter, manage state, handle UI elements, and potentially integrate with backend services (depending on the features implemented).

## Features Implemented (List the features you have successfully implemented)

* **Basic UI Structure:**
    * Home screen with tabs for Chats, Status, and Calls.
    * Individual chat screen.
    * Basic profile view.
* **Chat Functionality (if implemented):**
    * Displaying a list of chats.
    * Sending and receiving text messages (may be simulated or connected to a backend).
    * Displaying message timestamps.
* **Status Functionality (if implemented):**
    * Viewing status updates from contacts (may be static or simulated).
* **Calls Functionality (if implemented):**
    * Displaying a list of call logs (may be static or simulated).
* **UI Elements and Design:**
    * Utilizing Flutter widgets to create a user-friendly interface.
    * Adhering to a design similar to WhatsApp (colors, icons, layout).
* **State Management (Specify the state management solution used, e.g., Provider, BLoC, Riverpod, setState):**
    * [Mention the state management approach used and why.]
* **Other Features (if any):**
    * [List any other specific features you implemented.]

## Features Planned (List any features you intended to implement but haven't yet)

* Real-time messaging using a backend service (e.g., Firebase, Socket.IO).
* Sending and receiving media (images, videos).
* Audio and video calling.
* Status updates with images and videos.
* Group chats.
* End-to-end encryption (conceptual understanding).
* User authentication.

## Technologies Used

* **Flutter:** The primary framework for building the mobile application.
* **Dart:** The programming language used for Flutter development.
* **[List any other Flutter packages/dependencies used, e.g., provider, http, firebase_core, etc.]**
* **[Mention any backend technologies or services you might have experimented with, e.g., Firebase, Node.js, etc. If none, you can omit this.]**
